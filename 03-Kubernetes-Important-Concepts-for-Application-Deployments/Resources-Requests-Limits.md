# Kubernetes - Requests and Limits

## Step-01: Introduction

- We can specify how much each container a pod needs the resources like CPU & Memory.
- When we provide this information in our pod, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on.
- When you specify a resource limit for a Container, the kubelet enforces those `limits` so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set.
- The kubelet also reserves at least the `request` amount of that system resource specifically for that container to use.

## Step-02: Add Requests & Limits

```yml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi" # 128 MebiByte is equal to 135 Megabyte (MB)
    cpu: "500m" # `m` means milliCPU
  limits:
    memory: "500Mi"
    cpu: "1000m" # 1000m is equal to 1 VCPU core
```
