# aws-eks

This repository has code examples and few screenshots from the Udemy Course AWS EKS Kubernetes-Masterclass | DevOps, Microservices. This is only study purpose and not for any commercial purpose.

I have documented my own [notes](NOTES.md) for my understanding. I will keep the notes the up-to-date as when I come across anything new about AWS EKS and related K8s Special Interest Groups.
